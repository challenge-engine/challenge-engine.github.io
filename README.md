# challenge-engine.github.io
A GitHub based engine to run data challenges with distributed computing and scoring.

## Motivation
Challenge platforms use to be closed. The challenge engine aims to provide an open framework and make it easy for other labs to set up and customize their own challenges.  
It also enables us to set up distributed private datasets on which the code could be run for testing and scoring. This opens up the possibility to include hospital data and other datasets which could not be shared openly, to benefit from the developments during the challenge.
